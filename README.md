# GenAI

GenAI (QuickAI) is designed to make starting up AIs (particularly neural networks, at the present) quick.

**GenAI is very, very early in development;** it is being released in case it may be useful to you even in it's early state. Please feel free to make contributions, there is a need for both documentation and code.

At the present, GenAI does not include much documentation, but it can quickly (in a single line of code) create dense neural networks and generative adverserial networks. Also included is dAlI, a quick GAN creator for image generation.

The Holocron.Foundation is releasing GenAI under the CC0 license: you may use it however you like, without attribution (though it is appreciated).
